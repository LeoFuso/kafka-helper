### Kafka Helper

A simple App created to help developers working with Kafka in development, local or production environments.

Most of the use cases were implemented assuming a Schema Registry, by offering support for working with Avro Schemas, 
locally or remotely (e.g., using Schema Registry Api).

Feel free to increment, use, re-implement, or whatever, as long as it helps you!
